## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Features**: Age, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, etc.
- **Target**: Presence of heart disease (binary classification)

## Steps Performed
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trained models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Score
