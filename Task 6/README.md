# Task 6: House Price Prediction

## Objective
Predict house prices based on property features like carpet area, number of bathrooms, and location.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle House Price Dataset
- **Columns**: Carpet Area, Bathroom, Balcony, Location, Price

## Steps Performed
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (handled missing values and encoded categorical features)
- Trained models:
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluated using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Visualized actual vs predicted prices

## Tools & Libraries
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Results
- MAE: 4.5 Lakhs
- RMSE: 6.8 Lakhs
- Gradient Boosting achieved high accuracy for price prediction
